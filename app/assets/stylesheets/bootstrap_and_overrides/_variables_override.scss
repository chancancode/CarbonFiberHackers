/*
	For a list of variables you can override, see: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss

	You can also look at a bootswatch theme's variables file for an example, e.g. https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootswatch/superhero/_variables.scss

	Pasting in the code from the previous link has the same effect as uncommenting line 13 in bootstrap_and_overrides.
