/*
	1. Bootswatch theme

	For a list of Bootswatch themes, see http://bootswatch.com

	Our project depends on https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails, which converted the
	Bootswatch themes into SCSS stylesheets (from LESS). However, the SCSS versions is not 100%
	up to date. Based on my testing they seems to work just fine, so feel free to enable it and
	experiement.

	2. Overriding Bootstrap/Bootswatch variables

	Bootstrap/Bootswatch variables must be overriden before bootstrap is loaded for them to take
	effect.

	3. Now we can import bootstrap itself.

	4. Bootswatch theme (cont'd)

	To enable a Bootswatch theme, you'd also need to load its stylesheet here.

	5. Font Awesome More

	Font Awesome More (http://gregoryloucas.github.com/Font-Awesome-More/) replaces bootstrap's icon-*
	graphics with vector fonts, so it can be set to any color and will look good at any size (including
	retina displays). It also adds a ton of icons.

	6. Finally, we can add our own Bootstrap customizations here.
