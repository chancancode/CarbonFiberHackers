	Your images should go into the app/assets/images directory.

	In order to reference them in your CSS files, you can use the image-url() function.
	For this to work, you must enable SCSS pre-processing on those files, i.e. add .scss to the filename.
	It is very important to use the image-url() function instead of the usual CSS url() syntax!
